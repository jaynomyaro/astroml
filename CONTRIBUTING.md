## Complexity Budget

New functions should stay under a McCabe cyclomatic complexity of **10**. CI will fail if any function exceeds **15**. Maintainability is preferred over cleverness — if a function is complex, consider splitting it.

- **Soft limit (10):** Reported as a warning in CI. New functions should aim for this.
- **Hard limit (15):** CI failure. Existing functions above this should be refactored when touched.

Use `python -m astroml.ci.complexity_check astroml api` locally before submitting.

## Logging Standards

All modules must use the structured logger from `astroml.utils.logging`. Avoid `print()` in library code; use `logger.info()` or `logger.debug()` instead. Critical paths (ingestion, training, API entrypoints) must include structured log emission.

- `DEBUG` for verbose diagnostic telemetry
- `INFO` for normal operational events
- `WARNING` for recoverable anomalies
- `ERROR` for failures that do not stop the process
- `CRITICAL` for unrecoverable failures

Use `logger.exception(...)` inside `except` blocks to capture tracebacks.

## Type Annotations

Use built-in parameterized generics where possible (`dict[str, Any]`, `list[str]`). We target Python 3.10+. Public API signatures should be fully type-annotated.

## Style

- Run `black`, `ruff`, and type checks before submitting.
- Document public classes, methods, and functions. Run `make lint-docs` to
  enforce the repository's docstring coverage floor before submitting.
- Keep functions small and testable.
