# AstroML

## Dynamic Graph Machine Learning Framework for the Stellar Network

**AstroML** is a research-driven Python framework for building **dynamic graph machine learning models** on the Stellar Development Foundation Stellar blockchain.

It treats blockchain data as a **multi-asset, time-evolving graph**, enabling advanced ML research on transaction networks such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, and behavioral modeling.

---

## ✨ Features

AstroML provides end-to-end tooling for:

* Ledger ingestion and normalization
* Dynamic transaction graph construction
* Feature engineering for blockchain accounts
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
* Self-supervised node embeddings
* Anomaly detection
* Temporal modeling
* Reproducible ML experimentation

## 🧠 Core Idea

Blockchain networks are naturally **graph-structured systems**:

| Blockchain Concept | Graph Representation |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Accounts           | Nodes                |
| Transactions       | Directed edges       |
| Assets             | Edge types           |
| Time               | Dynamic dimension    |

Most analytics tools rely on static heuristics or SQL queries.

**AstroML instead enables:**

* Dynamic graph learning
* Temporal GNNs
* Representation learning
* Research-grade experimentation

## 🎯 Target Users

AstroML is designed for:

* ML researchers
* Graph ML engineers
* Fraud detection teams
* Blockchain data scientists

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

```
Ledger → Ingestion → Normalization → Graph Builder → Features → GNN/ML Models → Experiments
```


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Traqora/astroml.git
cd astroml
```

### 2. Create environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure database

Create a PostgreSQL database and update:

```
config/database.yaml
```

---

## 📥 Data Ingestion

Backfill ledgers:

```bash
python -m astroml.ingestion.backfill \
  --start-ledger 1000000 \
  --end-ledger 1100000
```

---

## 🕸 Build Graph Snapshot

Create a rolling time window graph:

```bash
python -m astroml.graph.build_snapshot --window 30d
```

---


## 🧪 Synthetic Fraud Pattern Injection

Create benchmark datasets by injecting controlled fraud structures into a clean ledger copy:

```bash
python -m astroml.ingestion.synthetic_fraud_injector \
  --input data/clean_ledger.jsonl \
  --output data/ledger_with_fraud.jsonl \
  --summary outputs/fraud_injection_summary.json \
  --sybil-clusters 3 \
  --sybil-cluster-size 8 \
  --wash-loops 2 \
  --wash-loop-size 5
```

The injector appends transactions tagged with `synthetic_fraud=true` and `fraud_pattern` (`sybil_cluster` or `wash_trading_loop`) for downstream benchmarking.
