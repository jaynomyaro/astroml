# Security Audit Checklist — AstroML / Fraud Registry

## 1. Smart Contract (Soroban / Rust)

### 1.1 Access Control
- [x] Admin-only functions (`register_validator`, `update_config`, `deactivate_validator`, `update_validator_reputation`) verify the caller matches the stored admin address
- [x] Non-admin callers receive `Error::Unauthorized`
- [ ] **REVIEW:** `__init__` has no guard against re-initialization — a second call overwrites the admin; add a storage-existence check before writing
- [ ] Admin key rotation mechanism is not implemented; document the operational runbook for key compromise

### 1.2 Input Validation
- [x] `confidence` and `reputation` values > 100 are rejected with `Error::InvalidInput`
- [x] Boundary values 0 and 100 are accepted as valid
- [ ] **REVIEW:** Empty `reason` string is not rejected; add minimum-length check to prevent griefing with no-evidence reports
- [ ] `consensus_threshold` of 0 would mark every account as fraudulent immediately; add a lower-bound check (≥ 1)

### 1.3 Replay / Duplicate Prevention
- [x] Duplicate reports from the same validator for the same account are blocked via `Error::AlreadyReported`
- [x] Unique validator counting in `is_fraudulent` prevents a single address inflating consensus

### 1.4 Sybil Resistance
- [x] Reputation minimum enforced before accepting reports
- [x] Configurable `consensus_threshold` requires independent validators
- [ ] **REVIEW:** Admin can register unlimited validators and immediately set high reputations — document trusted-setup assumption or add a time-lock

### 1.5 Integer Safety
- [x] `u8` arithmetic for reputation/confidence cannot overflow standard addition since values are validated to ≤ 100
- [x] `u64` counters (`report_count`, `accurate_reports`) use saturating Soroban semantics
- [ ] Confirm `consensus_threshold` comparison (`validator_count >= data.consensus_threshold`) uses matching integer types to avoid sign-extension issues

### 1.6 Storage
- [ ] TTL / expiry of instance storage not configured — very old fraud reports persist indefinitely; consider archival strategy
- [x] Single `DATA_KEY` storage is atomic per ledger operation; no partial-write risk

### 1.7 Denial of Service
- [ ] `get_active_validators` iterates all validators — unbounded; large validator sets could exhaust gas; consider pagination
- [ ] `get_fraud_reports` iterates all reports per account — same concern for heavily-targeted accounts

## 2. Python ML Pipeline

### 2.1 Injection Attacks
- [ ] All raw SQL queries must use parameterised statements (SQLAlchemy ORM or `%s` placeholders); audit `astroml/db/` for string-formatted queries
- [ ] Graph construction paths that accept external filenames must be validated against a whitelist of allowed directories

### 2.2 Secrets Management
- [x] `config/database.yaml` is listed in `.gitignore` (verify)
- [ ] Ensure no credentials are hard-coded in source files (run `git grep -n "password\|secret\|api_key"`)
- [ ] Database passwords should be read from environment variables, not YAML files checked into VCS

### 2.3 Dependency Security
- [ ] Run `pip-audit` against `requirements.txt` to identify known CVEs
- [ ] Pin all dependency versions and maintain a lock file (`pip-compile`)
- [ ] Rust dependencies: run `cargo audit` against `Cargo.lock`

### 2.4 Deserialization
- [ ] Pickle-based model serialisation (`torch.save` / `torch.load`) must only load files from trusted paths; never load user-supplied model files directly

### 2.5 Data Leakage
- [ ] Training labels must not be visible to the model during inference evaluation (covered by `tests/test_leakage.py`)
- [ ] Logged metrics / artefacts must not contain PII from Stellar account addresses in plaintext

### 2.6 Configuration Security
- [ ] Hydra / YAML configs must validate types and ranges on load; reject unknown keys
- [ ] `consensus_threshold` and other thresholds in `configs/` should have documented acceptable ranges

## 3. Infrastructure

### 3.1 Docker
- [ ] Base images pinned to digest, not floating tags
- [ ] Container does not run as root (`USER` directive set in `Dockerfile`)
- [ ] No secrets in `docker-compose.yml` environment blocks in plaintext

### 3.2 CI/CD
- [ ] Add `cargo audit` step to CI pipeline
- [ ] Add `pip-audit` or `safety check` step to CI pipeline
- [ ] Secret scanning (e.g., `git-secrets` or GitHub secret scanning) enabled on the repository
