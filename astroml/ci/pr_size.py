"""Pull request size evaluation (Issue #557).

Large pull requests are harder to review and carry more merge risk. This
module implements the *soft* enforcement policy used by the
``pr-size-limit`` GitHub Actions workflow:

* a PR over the thresholds gets a warning comment,
* CI is never failed because of size alone,
* ``refactor:large`` raises the file-count ceiling for planned refactors,
* ``[large PR]`` in the title opts out of the check entirely.

The evaluation logic lives here (rather than inline in ``github-script``)
so it is type-checked by ``mypy`` and covered by unit tests. The workflow
invokes it as ``python -m astroml.ci.pr_size``.
