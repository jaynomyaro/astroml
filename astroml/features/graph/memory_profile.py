"""Lightweight memory profiling for graph-building operations — issue #546.

Deliberately dependency-light: only ``tracemalloc`` (stdlib) and ``psutil``
(already an astroml dependency used elsewhere, e.g. :mod:`astroml.benchmarking.utils`).
``astroml.benchmarking`` is *not* reused here because it unconditionally imports
``torch`` at module load time, which would drag a heavy, unrelated dependency into
every caller of :mod:`astroml.features.graph`.
