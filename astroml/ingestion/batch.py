"""Chunked UPSERT batching for ingestion writes.

Provides batch accumulation and chunked persistence of ORM models
to reduce database round-trips during high-throughput ingestion.

Key components:
- BatchBuffer: Accumulates models and flushes in configurable chunks
- chunked_merge: Context manager for chunked merge + commit cycles
- batch_upsert: One-shot chunked upsert for a sequence of models
