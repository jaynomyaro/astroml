    SSE plus automatic reconnection makes delivery **at-least-once**: when a
    connection drops, Horizon replays the tail of the stream it had already
    started sending, so the same transaction can arrive again. A handler that
    submits claims or moves money must therefore be idempotent, or must not see
    the replay at all.

    By default the client drops replays for you: a transaction whose
    ``paging_token`` was already delivered is logged at ``DEBUG`` and counted in
    :attr:`duplicates_skipped` instead of being handed to the handler again. The
    cursor is still advanced, so skipping never rewinds the stream. Pass
    ``dedupe=False`` to opt out and receive raw at-least-once delivery.

    Transactions with no ``paging_token`` cannot be identified and are always
    delivered. The memory used for de-duplication is bounded by
    ``dedupe_capacity`` tokens.
