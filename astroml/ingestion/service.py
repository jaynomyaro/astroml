        Unlike :meth:`ingest`, this never accumulates the requested range into a
        list: it's a generator that yields ``(ledger_id, LedgerOutcome)`` as each
        ledger is fetched/processed, so a caller driving a large backfill (e.g.
        1M ledgers) holds only the current ledger's payload in memory, not the
        whole range's worth of ids/results.

        Backpressure: fetch → process → persist happens synchronously per
        ledger before the next ``fetch_fn`` call, so a slow ``process_fn``
        naturally throttles how fast ``fetch_fn`` runs — there's no read-ahead
        buffer to overflow.

        ``batch_size`` (default 100, must be >= 1) controls two things, both
        bounded rather than growing with the range size:

        - How often progress is logged.
        - How often processed-ledger state is flushed to the
          :class:`~astroml.ingestion.state.StateStore`. The naive per-ledger
          ``StateStore.mark_processed`` call reloads *and* re-serialises the
          entire processed-ledger set from disk on every single call — fine
          for a handful of ledgers, but quadratic (and, empirically,
          minutes-slow past a few thousand ledgers) over a large backfill.
          Flushing once per batch instead turns that into a small constant
          factor of ``1/batch_size`` while keeping the flush cadence bounded
          and configurable.

        Trade-off: on a crash mid-batch, up to ``batch_size - 1`` already
        processed ledgers may not yet be durably recorded and will be
        reprocessed on restart — the existing idempotency contract
        (``process_fn`` should tolerate being called again for the same
        ledger) already covers this. The final partial batch is always
        flushed before the generator returns or is closed early (e.g. the
        caller stops iterating partway through), via a ``finally`` block.
