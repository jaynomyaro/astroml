"""Celery task: build transaction graph from a ledger range — issue #296.

In production this task would load transaction edges from the database,
construct a NetworkX / PyG graph, and persist it to the feature store.
The current implementation is a placeholder that simulates the workload
with a short sleep and returns node/edge count metadata.
