"""Secrets audit for the Docker build context (#940).

Two guarantees, both enforceable in CI without a Docker daemon:

1. **``.dockerignore`` blocks secret material from the build context.**
   The ``Dockerfile`` ``COPY``s ``astroml/``, ``migrations/``, ``docs/``,
   ``examples/`` (and the runner image also ``tests/``) into the image, and
   the context is the repo root — so every env file, private key, and
   credential blob in the tree is one careless ``COPY .`` away from being
   baked into a published image. The ignore list must explicitly exclude
   them (``!.env.example`` stays allowed: it only holds placeholders).

2. **No build-context file ships a real URI-embedded credential.**
   A ``scheme://user:password@host`` string in any file the context picks
   up is a leaked secret unless it is a known dev placeholder or
   placeholder-marked. ``REPLACE_WITH`` / ``change_me`` markers count as
   placeholders; anything else with a password-looking segment fails.

``astroml/ingestion/normalizer.py`` is the module this issue pins as the
relevant area: its CLI reads operation JSON from stdin or a file path, so
any operator workflow that pipes credentials through the build context
would silently flow into images too — keeping secrets out of the context
is what keeps them out of every image built from it.
