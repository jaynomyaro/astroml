"""End-to-end integration test for the ingestion → graph → features
pipeline (#193).

Uses an in-memory `StateStore` (file-backed but writes to a pytest tmp
dir so the test is self-contained), a small synthetic ledger dataset,
and a deterministic seed. No external Postgres / Stellar RPC is needed.

The test is `@pytest.mark.e2e` so the CPU CI matrix (#186) picks it up
under its default `not gpu` selector.
