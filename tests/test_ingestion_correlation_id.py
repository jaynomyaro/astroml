"""Tests for correlation-id / tracing propagation through ingestion — issues #944, #950.

:class:`~astroml.ingestion.service.IngestionService` previously never touched
the request/trace-correlation contextvar exposed by
:mod:`astroml.utils.logging`, so log lines emitted while an ingestion run was
in flight (including from user-supplied ``fetch_fn``/``process_fn`` callbacks)
carried no ``request_id`` and couldn't be correlated back to a single run.

These tests cover:
- #944 (tracing propagation): a correlation id is present and stable for the
  full duration of one ``ingest_stream``/``ingest`` call, including inside
  caller-supplied callbacks, and is restored afterwards.
- #950 (request-id correlation): a caller-supplied correlation id (e.g. one
  already set by an upstream HTTP handler) is inherited rather than
  overwritten, and independent runs get distinct ids when none is inherited.
